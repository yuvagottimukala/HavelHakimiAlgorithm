This is an implimentation of the Havel Hakimi Algorithm to determine if a potential graph degree sequence is graphical or not. 
The Havel-Hakimi algorithm is based on the following theorem.

Let A=(s,t1,...,ts,d1,...,dn) be a finite list of nonnegative integers that is nonincreasing. Let A'=(t1−1,...,ts−1,d1,...,dn) be a second finite list of nonnegative integers that is rearranged to be nonincreasing. List A is graphic if and only if list A' is graphic. If the given list A is graphic, then the theorem will be applied at most n-1 times setting in each further step A:=A′. Note that it can be necessary to sort this list again. This process ends when the whole list A' consists of zeros. Let G be a simple graph with the degree sequence A: Let the vertex S have degree s; let the vertices {T1,...,Ts} have respective degrees {t1,...,ts}; let the vertices {D1,...,Ds} have respective degrees {d1,...,ds}. In each step of the algorithm, one constructs the edges of a graph with vertices {T1,...,Ts} —i.e., if it is possible to reduce the list A to A', then we add edges {S,T1},{S,T2},...,{S,Ts}. When the list  cannot be reduced to a list  of nonnegative integers in any step of this approach, the theorem proves that the list  from the beginning is not graphic.

Use the file Test.py to input a potential degree sequence to see if there exists a graph with that degree sequence or not.
